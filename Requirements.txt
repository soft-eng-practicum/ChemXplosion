Revision 1.0


1. Introduction

Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to complete the first level on the previously designed learning module, fixing many issues that 
do not allow the game to function properly. There will be additional features added to the game to have more content.

Project Scope:

The project will focus primarily on making the original module/game to become a working product. The original puzzles must be 
fixed in order for there to be an actual goal in the game. The first level will need some polishing and tweaking so the game 
will provide a better user experience. There will be an additional level that will contain more chemical equations that are 
based around stoichiometry.

Goals:

- Fix all issues that are current with the first level
- Improve and polish existing features
- Add additional features to improve gameplay and learning
